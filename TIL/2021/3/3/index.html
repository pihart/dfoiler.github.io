						Today I learned (formally) about locally constant functions. We take the following abstract definition.
					</p>
					<div class="definition">
						<p>
							<b>
								Definition.
							</b>
							For topological space $X$ and set $S,$ we say $f:X\to S$ is locally constant if and only if, for each $x\in X,$ there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(X)=\{f(x)\}.$
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						It is a fact (that we will prove) that locally constant functions on $\RR$ are in fact constant everywhere. This is not hard to visualize: if every point has a little interval around it where $f$ is constant, then we can imagine extending out these intervals out to all of $\RR.$ Note how similar this feels to compactness.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyways, we claim the following, which is stronger. The following is (almost) a characterization of locally constant functions.
					</p>
					<div class="proposition">
						<p>
							<b>
								Proposition.
							</b>
							If $f:X\to S$ is locally constant, then $f$ is locally constant on connected components of $X.$
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						Fix any $x\in X,$ and we show that $f$ is constant on the connected component of $x.$ In fact, we claim that\[Y:=\{y\in X:f(y)=f(x)\}\]is both closed and open. This is open because, for any $y\in Y,$ we can select an open neighborhood $U_y$ of $y$ on which $f$ is locally constant. Then each $U_y\subseteq Y,$ and surely\[Y=\bigcup_{y\in Y}U_y.\]So $Y$ is open.
					</p>
					<p>
						Conversely, this is closed because the complement of $Y$ is\[\{y\in X:f(y)\in S\setminus\{f(x)\}\}=\bigcup_{s\in S\setminus\{f(x)\}}\{y\in X:f(y)=s\}.\]We already know that each $\{y\in X:f(y)=s\}$ is open by either the above argument or because it is empty, so it follows $X\setminus Y$ in total is open.
					</p>
					<p>
						To finish, let $C_x$ be the connected component of $x\in X.$ This implies that both $C_x\cap Y$ and $C_x\cap(X\setminus Y)$ are open in the subspace of topology of $C_x,$ and these two open sets are disjoint and partition $C_x.$ So because $C_x$ is by definition connected, we must have one of $C_x\cap Y$ or $C_x\cap(X\setminus Y)$ be empty, but $x\in C_x\cap Y,$ so\[C_x\cap(X\setminus Y)=\emp.\]But this requires $C_x\subseteq Y,$ so $f(C_x)=\{f(x)\}.$ So we are done here. $\blacksquare$
					</p>
					<p>
						We remark now that the connectedness of $\RR$ implies what we wanted, and no compactness condition was necessary. Of course, compactness provides a nice visual for what the argument above is doing, but it is less efficient. Anywyas, if we wanted to rigorize the compactness argument, I think the least-upper principle on $Y$ can get $Y=\RR$ quickly.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also note here that this characterization of locally constant is pretty unhelpful on totally disconnected spaces. (We do care about totally disconnected spaces because of $\QQ_p.$) To fix our intuitive picture, I think it's helpful to attach the discrete topology on $S$ and visualize $f$ as continuous. That is, "locally constant'' is somehow similar to "continuous'' on totally disconnected spaces.
					</p>
					<p>
						To be explicit, Tate's thesis is concerned with Fourier analysis on "smooth'' functions on which "tend to $0$ rapidly.'' On $\RR$ or $\CC,$ we can just say that $f:\RR\to\CC$ is in $C^\infty$ and has all of its derivatives go to $0.$ But on local fields, we make "smooth'' into "locally constant'' and "tend to $0$ rapidly'' into "compact support.'' We have the following characterization; read as $F=\QQ_p.$
					</p>
					<div class="proposition">
						<p>
							<b>
								Proposition.
							</b>
							Fix $F$ a non-Archimedean topological field. Suppose $f:F\to\CC$ is locally constant and has compact support. Then $f$ is a $\CC$-linear combination of indicators on open sets.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						For $x\in F,$ denote $B_x$ an open ball (inside an open neighborhood) around $x$ such that $f$ is constant. We would like to just sum indicators on all of these open balls, but there are infinitely many. The main trick is that\[\op{supp}f\subseteq\bigcup_{x\in\op{supp}f}B_x,\]so we have an open cover of $\op{supp}f.$ So we are allowed to extract a finite subcover named $\{B_{x_k}\}_{k=1}^N.$ Because $F$ is non-Archimedean, these balls are either disjoint or contain each other, so we can refine our cover to consist of disjoint balls. From this we claim\[f=\sum_{k=1}^Nf(x_k)\cdot1_{B_{x_k}}.\]Note that this will finish the proof of the proposition. Indeed, for $x\in F,$ if $x$ is in no open ball $B_{x_\bullet},$ then $x\not\in\op{supp}f,$ so $f(x)=0$ anyways. But if $x\in B_{x_\bullet}$ for some $x_\bullet,$ then $x_\bullet$ is in exactly one such ball by disjointness. Further, $f$ is constant on $B_{x_\bullet},$ so $f(x)=f(x_\bullet),$ and our claim is finished. $\blacksquare$
