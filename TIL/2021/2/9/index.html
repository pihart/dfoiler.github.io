					<h2>February 9th</h2>
					<p>Today I learned the baby-step giant-step algorithm to solve the discrete log problem in general finite cyclic groups. As implied, our setup is to fix a finite cyclic group $G=\langle g\rangle$ of order $N$ and element $h\in G$ so that we want $x\in\ZZ$ satisfying $h=g^x.$ We note that the way we represent elements of $G$ is unimportant, as it should be in this algorithm.</p>
					<p>Brute force would be trying all $N$ different values of $x$ until hitting the correct one. This requires $O(1)$ space but a terrible $O(N)$ run-time. The baby-step giant-step algorithm trades some of the $O(1)$ space for a better run-time, akin to the Dirichlet hyperbola method. The key observation is that\[\frac x{\sqrt N}\le\sqrt N.\]More explicitly, this implies that any $x$ can be written as\[x=a\lceil\sqrt N\rceil+b\]where $0\le a,b{\lt}\lceil\sqrt N\rceil.$ So if we can check $\lceil\sqrt N\rceil$ values of $x$ simultaneously, our run-time will drop to $O(\sqrt N).$</p>
					<p>The way that this is done is by storing $\lceil\sqrt N\rceil$ values of $x$ in a lookup table. Here are the steps.					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>     Store $g^0,g^1,\ldots,g^{\lceil\sqrt N\rceil-1}$ in a lookup table.</li>
						<li>     Precompute $g^{\lceil\sqrt N\rceil}$ into $g_*.$</li>
						<li>     Move $h$ into a local $h_*.$</li>
						<li>     Loop the following over $0\le a{\lt}\lceil\sqrt N\rceil.$					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>         If $h_*$ is in the lookup table, return $a\lceil\sqrt N\rceil+b.$</li>
						<li>         Else move $h_*g_*$ into $h_*.$ Now $h_*=hg_*^{-a-1},$ and we're ready to loop.</li>
					</ol>
					<p></li>
					</ol>
					<p>We note that this is gauranteed to terminate because $x=a\lceil\sqrt N\rceil+b$ for some $0\le a,b{\lt}\lceil\sqrt N\rceil$ as above, so we'll find our output eventually.</p>
					<p>As for quick run-time analysis, we note that creation of the lookup table and the loop are our limiting $O(\sqrt N)$ operations. There is some worry that the loop operation isn't $O(1),$ but we note that this can be done by hashing: we can hash $h_*$ in and then check the hashed entry in a table in $O(1)$ time without having to check each element of the lookup table manually. This also means that the creation of the lookup table requires hashing, but this is still an $O(\sqrt N)$ operation in total.</p>
					<p>We close by remarking that no part of the proof required $G$ to have exactly $N$ elements. We merely needed $|G|\le N$ to make the bounding work out when sieving for $x.$ I find this somewhat remarkable and "best possible'' in terms of what we get to know about the group. That is, if we want a discrete log algorithm of a group, knowing exactly how many elements are in the group feels unnecessary. But to upper-bound run-time of the algorithm, we probably need an upper-bound on the group size.</p>
