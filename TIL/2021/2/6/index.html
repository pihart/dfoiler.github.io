						Today I learned how to recover the modulus of a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator, from
						<a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/4306">
							here
						</a>
						. Very quickly, a linear congruential generator is a sequence of pseudorandom modular classes $a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots$ defined by a seed $a_0$ and the recurrence relation\[a_{n+1}\equiv Aa_n+B\pmod N\]for some constants $A,B,N.$ The question is how we should back-construct $A,B,N$ if given some (hopefully small) number of terms of $a_\bullet$; this would let us predict the rest of the pseudorandom sequence and is therefore bad. We note that if we know $N,$ we see\[\begin{cases}    a_1\equiv Aa_0+B\pmod N, \\    a_2\equiv Aa_1+B\pmod N\end{cases}\]is a system of linear congruences. Assuming that the sequence is kind, we can use this to solve for $A$ and $B$ by just solving with row reduction in the normal way. Thus, we can recover $A$ and $B$ given $N$ in roughly $3$ terms. Explicitly, subtracting and then solving gives\[A\equiv\frac{a_2-a_1}{a_1-a_0},\qquad B\equiv a_1-Aa_0\pmod N.\]We remark that "the sequence is kind'' means that $\gcd(u_1-u_0,N)=1$ so that we can actually do division here. However, this is a non-problem, for $\gcd(u_1-u_0,N)$ will get propagated through the entire sequence, so we can just divide it from all terms, and then do the modular division safely. Note if $u_1-u_0\equiv0,$ then the sequence is constant.
					</p>
					<p>
						It remains to solve for the modulus $N$ from our sequence. The outline is that our linear recurrence lets us generate modular classes, so we might be able to turn this into a way to generate numbers $0\pmod N,$ in which case we should be able to take $\gcd$ to get $N.$ To begin, we get rid of the constant term by defining\[b_n:=a_{n+1}-a_n.\]With $n+1$ consecutive terms of $a_\bullet,$ we can solve for $n$ terms of $b_\bullet,$ so we will need more terms, but so it goes. Anyways, the nice thing is that\[b_{n+1}\equiv(a_{n+2}-a_{n+1})\equiv A(a_{n+1}-a_n)\equiv Ab_n.\]To turn this into a sequence $0\pmod N,$ we define\[c_n:=b_{n+2}b_n-b_{n+1}^2\equiv A^2b_n-A^2b_n\equiv0\pmod N.\]We need yet another term of $a_\bullet$ for the $c_\bullet$ sequence, but so it goes. Anyways, this generates a lot of numbers which are $0\pmod N.$ At a high level, we expect\[\gcd(c_0,c_1,\ldots)=N\gcd\left(\frac{c_0}N,\frac{c_1}N,\ldots\right)=N\]because there's no reason that $c_\bullet/N$ should have any common factors. For example, even if we were just to look at $\gcd(c_n/N,c_{n+1}/N),$ we expect this to be $1$ with probability $6/\pi^2$ for each $n.$ So after $10$ terms, the probability is less than $1\%.$ Thus, about $12$ terms of $a_\bullet$ is probably sufficient to get $N.$
					</p>
					<p>
						I don't think a proof of this heuristic would be easy. The sequence $c_\bullet$ only looks pseudorandom because $a_\bullet$ looks random, which is difficult to pin down. Further, getting some proven bound on the number of terms of $a_\bullet$ or $c_\bullet$ feels unhelpful: I get the feeling that what can be proven will be significantly worse than the heuristic (and probably practical use) suggests.
