						Today I learned about the $p$-adic Gaussian to derive the completed Riemann $\xi$ function, from
						<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/07/27/tates-proof-of-the-functional-equation/">

						. We're going to synthetically derive the $\Gamma$ factor of the $\xi$ function, and then this will give us an idea of how to synthetically derive the entire $\xi$ function.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fix $G_\infty(x)=e^{-\pi x^2}$ to be our Gaussian over $\RR=\QQ_\infty.$ Recall that we also have the Gaussian $G_p(x)=1_{\ZZ_p}$ on $\QQ_p$ as we showed two days ago. Additionally, we want our $\Gamma$ factor to be\[\Gamma_\infty(s):=\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)=\pi^{-s/2}\int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{s/2}\,\frac{dt}t.\]The correct to do here is to attempt to make $G_\infty$ appear in this expression. So we take $t\mapsto\pi t^2$ and $dt/t\mapsto 2dt/t,$ giving\[\Gamma_\infty(s)=2\int_0^\infty e^{-\pi t^2}t^s\,\frac{dt}t.\]Now this definition looks more motivated, for we get to write\[\Gamma_\infty(s)=\int_{\QQ_\infty^\times}G_\infty(t)|t|^s\,\frac{dt}{|t|},\]and all the artifacts of $\RR$ have disappeared: we can define the $\Gamma_\infty$ factor as (twice) the Mellin transform of the Gaussian! Further, note that $dt/|t|$ is a Haar measure on $\QQ_\infty^\times,$ so it feels a bit more natural (notationally) to integrate over $\QQ_\infty^\times$ instead of $\QQ_\infty\setminus\{0\}.$
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyways, this suggests that we define\[\Gamma_p(s):=\int_{\QQ_p^\times}G_p(t)|t_p|_p^s\left(\frac p{p-1}\cdot\frac{dt_p}{|t_p|_p}\right).\]We remark that we choose our measure $\frac p{p-1}\cdot\frac{dt_p}{|t_p|_p}$ to be a multiplicative measure on $\QQ_p^\times,$ scaled so that the units $\ZZ_p^\times=\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p$ has measure $1.$ We show explicitly that $\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p$ has the desired measure, for it's a basic case of something we'll do shortly. Essentially, $t_p\in\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p$ will always have $|t_p|_p=1,$ so\[\int_{\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p}\frac{dt_p}{|t_p|_p}=\int_{\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p}dt_p.\]Now, $\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p$ is made up of $p-1$ cosets of $\ZZ_p/p\ZZ_p,$ of which there are $p.$ So with the $p$ total cosets, which all have the same measure because $dt_p$ is shift-invariant, partitioning $\ZZ_p$ of measure $1,$ it follows each coset has measure $\frac1p.$ Thus,\[\int_{\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p}\frac{dt_p}{|t_p|_p}=\frac{p-1}p,\]which is what we wanted.

						This argument turns out to be helpful for the following claim, which is what we're really here for.

						This is a miracle. The $p$-adic $\Gamma$ factor turns out to be an Euler factor! We will make more comments on this later.
					</p>
					<p>
						At a high level, what makes this formula so nice is that our Gaussian $G_p$ is so nice. Because $G_p$ merely indicates $\ZZ_p,$ our integral over $\QQ_p^\times$ turns into an integral over $\ZZ_p\setminus\{0\}.$ So we see\[\Gamma_p(s)=\frac p{p-1}\int_{\ZZ_p\setminus\{0\}}|t_p|^s_p\,\frac{dt_p}{|t_p|_p}.\]Here we mimic the argument that $\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p$ has multiplicative maesure $1.$ We see $\ZZ_p$ is inherently granular, so we can make the integrand constant by summing over each possible $|x_p|_p.$ In particular, $x_p\in\ZZ_p\setminus\{0\}$ implies $|x_p|_p=p^{-\nu}$ for some nonnegative integer $\nu.$ So because $\ZZ_p\setminus\{0\}$ is countably partitioned by $\nu,$ we may write\[\Gamma_p(s)=\frac p{p-1}\sum_{\nu=0}^\infty\int_{|x_p|=p^{-\nu}}p^{-\nu s}\,\frac{dt_p}{p^{-\nu}}.\]Now, the integrand is constant with respect to $t_p,$ so we can move it out of the integral, giving\[\Gamma_p(s)=\frac p{p-1}\sum_{\nu=0}^\infty\frac{p^{-\nu s}}{p^{-\nu}}\int_{|x_p|=p^{-\nu}}dt_p.\]At this point, we can begin to see the $\left(1-p^{-s}\right)^{-1}$ coming from the infinite series. We note that $\left\{x_p:|x_p|=p^{-\nu}\right\}$ is the $p^\nu\ZZ_p\setminus p^{\nu+1}\ZZ_p,$ the set of elements divisible by $p^\nu$ but not $p^{\nu+1}.$ So our integral is\[\Gamma_p(s)=\frac p{p-1}\sum_{\nu=0}^\infty\frac{p^{-\nu s}}{p^{-\nu}}\int_{p^{\nu}\ZZ_p\setminus p^{\nu+1}\ZZ_p}dt_p.\]We can evaluate the integral as we did when showing $\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p$ has multiplicative measure $1.$ The coset $p^\nu\ZZ_p$ is one of $p^\nu$ in $\ZZ_p/p^\nu\ZZ_p,$ and all cosets have the same size, so the measure of $p^\nu\ZZ_p$ is $1/p^\nu.$ The same argument shows $p^{\nu+1}\ZZ_p$ has measure $1/p^{\nu+1},$ so\[\int_{p^{\nu}\ZZ_p\setminus p^{\nu+1}\ZZ_p}dt_p=\frac1{p^\nu}-\frac1{p^{\nu+1}}=\frac{p-1}{p^{\nu+1}}\]because $p^{\nu+1}\ZZ_p\subseteq p^\nu\ZZ_p.$ From here, we have\[\Gamma_p(s)=\frac p{p-1}\sum_{\nu=0}^\infty\frac{p^{-\nu s}}{p^{-\nu}}\cdot\frac{p-1}{p^{\nu+1}}.\]Simplifying, we see\[\Gamma_p(s)=\sum_{\nu=0}^\infty p^{-\nu s}=\frac1{1-p^{-s}},\]which is what we wanted. $\blacksquare$
					</p>
					<p>
						Quickly, we remark that if I were more comfortable with $p$-adic integration, we could write $d^\times t_p:=\frac p{p-1}\cdot\frac{dt_p}{|t_p|_p}$ as our multiplicative measure so that\[\int_{|t_p|_p=p^{-\nu s}}d^\times t_p=\int_{|t_p|_p=1}d^\times t_p=\int_{\ZZ_p\setminus p\ZZ_p}d^\times t_p=1\]because we are integrating over that multiplicative (!) measure. This is faster, but the multiplicative measure scares me.
					</p>
					<p>
						We now remark on the miracle that just happened. It would appear that we can define $\zeta$ synthetically (!) by\[\zeta(s)=\prod_{p \lt \infty}\Gamma_p(s),\]and this feels somewhat more natural than the the infinite sum definition. In particular, the analysis that we did above kind of implies that the "correct'' way to define our $\zeta$-functions is by an Euler product, which aligns with the way Artin $L$-functions are defined by Euler factors. Further,\[\xi(s)=\prod_\nu\Gamma_\nu(s),\]where $\nu$ ranges over all places (finite and infinite) of $\QQ.$ This presents a much more motivated view of the $\Gamma$ factor by placing it on equal footing with the rest of the Euler factors.
