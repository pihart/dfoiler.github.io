						Today I learned how to show intervals $[a,b]$ have Lebesgue measure $b-a.$ I don't think I'm going to complete showing that $\mu$ is a measure soon because it looks significantly more involved than I bargained for.
					</p>
					<p>
						Computing $\mu([a,b])$ is mostly to sanity-check that our definition makes sense. This turns out to be somewhat subtle&mdash;because we're using countably many intervals in our definition of $\mu,$ we have to deal with infinite sums somehow. What makes closed intervals nice is that they are compact, letting us deal with finite sums instead. We claim the following.
					</p>
					<div class="proposition">
						<p>
							<b>
								Proposition.
							</b>
							The closed interval $[a,b]$ for $a,b\in\RR$ has Lebesgue measure $b-a.$
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						To show this, we want.\[\mu([a,b])=\inf\left\{\sum_{k=0}^\infty(b_k-a_k):[a,b]\subseteq\bigcup_{k=0}^\infty(a_k,b_k)\right\}.\]Note that $(a-\varepsilon/2,b+\varepsilon/2)$ makes a basis cover of $[a,b]$ of length $b-a+\varepsilon,$ so sending $\varepsilon\to0$ means that $\mu([a,b])\ge b-a.$ For the reverse inequality, take any basis cover $\{(a_k,b_k)\}_{k=0}^\infty$ of $[a,b].$ We want to show\[\sum_{k=0}^\infty(b_k-a_k)\stackrel?\ge b-a.\]However, $[a,b]$ is compact (!), so we can extract a finite subcover from $\{(a_k,b_k)\}_{k=0}^\infty.$ Note that each interval has nonnegative $b_\bullet-a_\bullet,$ so the sum does not increase by removing all but finitely many of the intervals. Re-indexing, we name our subcover $\{(a_k,b_k)\}_{k=0}^N$ so that we want\[\sum_{k=0}^N(b_k-a_k)\stackrel?\ge b-a.\]The reason why a finite sum is nice is that we can now rearrange terms freely. The picture now is that the intervals $(a_\bullet,b_\bullet)$ should look something like this.
					</p>
					<img src="img1.png">
					<p>
						In particular, the differences $b_k-a_{k+1}$ are all positive while $a_0 \lt a$ and $b_N \gt b.$ This suggests how to get our inequality. To help with technicalities, we apply the following filters and rearranging.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								We get rid of any intervals in the $\{(a_k,b_k)\}_{k=0}^N$ that are a strict subset of any other interval.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								We get rid of intervals that do not intersect $[a,b]$ at all.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Among the $(a_\bullet,b_\bullet)$ with $a_\bullet \lt a,$ we choose the one with greatest $b_\bullet$ and get rid of the others. (This is effectively chooses the largest interval with respect to $[a,b].$)
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Similarly, among the $(a_\bullet,b_\bullet)$ with $a_\bullet \lt a,$ we choose the one with least $a_\bullet.$
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								We arrange the $(a_\bullet,b_\bullet)$ to ascend by $a_\bullet.$ We note that this makes the $b_\bullet$ ascend as well, for $a_k\le a_{k+1}$ with $b_k\ge b_{k+1}$ implies $(a_k,b_k)\supseteq(a_{k+1},b_{k+1}).$
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Now, we think about the sum like\[b_N+(-a_N+b_{N-1})+(-a_{N+1}-b_{N+2})+\cdots+(-a_1+b_0)-a_0\stackrel?\ge b-a.\]We note $b_N$ is the largest $b_\bullet,$ so we must have $b_N \gt b$ to cover $[a,b].$ Also, it is the only $b_\bullet$ with $b_\bullet \gt b$ because we filtered the others out. Similarly, $a_0 \lt a$ and is the only $a_\bullet$ with this property. Thus, $b_N-a_0\ge b-a,$ and we need to show the remaining terms are nonnegative.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our ordering by $a_\bullet$ means $a_{k+1}\in(a_k,b_k)$ or $k \lt N$ for each $k.$ Indeed, $a_{k+1}\ge a_k,$ and if $a_{k+1}\ge b_k,$ then all of the remaining $a_\bullet$ past $a_{k+1}$ are also at least $b_k,$ so $b_k$ never gets covered in $[a,b],$ which is a problem: $b_k \lt a$ means $(a_k,b_k)$ doesn't intersect $[a,b],$ and $b_k \gt b$ requires $k=N,$ for this is the only $k$ (the largest one) satisfying this.
					</p>
					<p>
						It follows $-a_{k+1}+b_k\ge0,$ so we see\[b_N+(-a_N+b_{N-1})+\cdots+(-a_1+b_0)-a_0\ge b-a.\]This is what we wanted. $\blacksquare$
					</p>
					<p>
						We take a second to remark that we have not actually shown $[a,b]$ is measurable, and I have not even defined what measurable means. For the sake of completeness, we take the following definition.
					</p>
					<div class="definition">
						<p>
							<b>
								Definition.
							</b>
							A set $A\subseteq\RR$ is Lebesgue-measurable if and only if $\mu(A)=\mu(A\cap S)+\mu(A\cap S^c)$ for all sets $S\subseteq\RR.$
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						It turns out that Lebesgue-measurable sets form a $\sigma$-algebra, so showing that (open or closed) intervals are Lebesgue-measurable implies that this is a Borel measure. (We still have to verify that countable disjoint unions can be separated.) I don't know how to prove either of these, but honestly that sounds like someone else's job.
