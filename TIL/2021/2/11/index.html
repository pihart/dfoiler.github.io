						Today I learned (finally) the proof that $[0,1]$ is compact in the standard topology on $\RR.$ Of course, the proof generalizes to show that $\RR$ is locally compact, but we don't bother with this.
					</p>
					<p>
						We begin by presenting the proof with no motivation. Suppose that $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\lambda}$ is an open cover of $[0,1].$ The trick is to consider\[S=\{\varepsilon\in(0,1]:[0,\varepsilon]\text{ can be covered with a finite subcover}\}.\]Very quickly, we remark that if $\varepsilon_0\in S,$ then each $\varepsilon \lt \varepsilon_0$ is also in $S.$ Indeed, if $[0,\varepsilon_0]$ can be finitely covered, then the same cover can be used to cover $[0,\varepsilon]\subseteq[0,\varepsilon_0].$
					</p>
					<p>
						We would like to use the least upper-bound property on $S.$ Note that some open set $U_\bullet$ covers $0$ and so contains an interval like $[0,2\varepsilon)$ for some $\varepsilon \gt 0.$ (Formally, dissolve $U_\bullet$ into intervals because by the basis of our topology; one such interval contains $0.$) This implies that $[0,\varepsilon]\subseteq U_\bullet$ can be finitely covered, so $\varepsilon\in S$ inhabits $S.$
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, $S$ has an upper bound: by definition, $\varepsilon\in S$ implies $\varepsilon\le1.$ Thus, we may apply the least upper-bound property and let $\varepsilon_0$ be the least upper bound of $S.$ Note $\varepsilon_0\le1$ because $1$ is an upper bound of $S.$ Further, we remark that, for $\alpha\in(0,1],$ we see $\alpha\not\in S$ implies nothing above $\alpha$ is in $S,$ so $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $S,$ so $\varepsilon_0\le\alpha.$ Thus, $\alpha \lt \varepsilon_0$ implies $\alpha\in S.$
					</p>
					<p>
						We now do casework on $\varepsilon_0.$
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								If $\varepsilon_0=1,$ then we can finish quickly. As before, we can pick up $U_\bullet$ containing $1,$ and then extract an interval $(\alpha,1]$ inside of $U_\bullet,$ where $\alpha \lt 1.$ In particular, $\alpha \lt \varepsilon_0,$ so $\alpha\in S.$ Thus we have a finite subcover    \[\{V_k\}_{k=1}^N\]    covering $[0,\alpha].$ To finish, we note    \[\{V_k\}_{k=1}^N\cup\{U_\bullet\}\]    which now finitely covers $[0,\alpha]\cup(\alpha,1]=[0,1]$ in full.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								If $\varepsilon_0 \lt 1,$ then we derive contradiction. To start, we pick up $U_\bullet$ containing $\varepsilon_0,$ and then extract an interval $(\alpha,\beta)$ inside of $U_\bullet$ which contains $\varepsilon_0.$ Now, again, $\alpha \lt \varepsilon_0,$ so $\alpha\in S,$ and we get a finite subcover    \[\{V_k\}_{k=1}^N\]    which covers $[0,\alpha].$ But then    \[\{V_k\}_{k=1}^N\cup\{U_\bullet\}\]    finitely covers $[0,\alpha]\cup(\alpha,\beta)=[0,\beta).$ In particular, we can cover $\left[0,\frac{\varepsilon_0+\beta}2\right]$ finitely, but $\frac{\varepsilon_0+\beta}2 \gt \varepsilon_0,$ breaking our least upper bound.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Having covered all cases, we conclude that we can always extract a finite subcover of $[0,1].$
					</p>
					<p>
						We remark with some motivation because the given proof is quite magical. The argument is somewhat motivated by pieces I heard of it a year ago but mainly (I would like to think) by the following framing. Imagine we are given an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\lambda}$ of $[0,1],$ and we need to extract a finite subcover.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can codify this situtaion as a game: I am allowed to query an "interval genie'' with a real number $r\in[0,1],$ and I will receive some $U_\bullet$ containing $r.$ Effectively, this is all of the power I have over my cover. The naive approach, now, to extract an efficient subcover, is the following.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Query the genie with $0.$ I get back some $U_\bullet$ containing the interval $[0,\varepsilon_0).$
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Query the genie with $\varepsilon_0.$ I get back some (maybe other) $U_\bullet$ containing the interval $(-,\varepsilon_1)$ containing $\varepsilon_0.$
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Query the genie with $\varepsilon_1.$ Rinse and repeat.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						This, of course, doesn't work because the genie can do things like giving me\[\left[0,\frac14\right),\left(\frac18,\frac38\right),\left(\frac5{16},\frac7{16}\right),\cdots,\left(\frac{2^n-3}{2^{n+1}},\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}\right),\cdots.\]Here I keep querying numbers of the form $\left(2^n-1\right)/2^{n+1},$ off to infinity, never even going to cover $\frac12$ with my generated subcover.
					</p>
					<p>
						The key observation is that, after I realize what the genie is doing to me, I can query the genie for $\frac12.$ This gives me some open interval containing $\frac12$ with a little space to the left, which means that I really only need finitely many of the genie's garbage intervals from before.
					</p>
					<p>
						As I understand, the argument presented above is more or less a formalization of this trick. Notably, this trick alone is not enough to get a finite subcover, for the genie could do the same thing trapping me below $\frac34,$ and then below $\frac78,$ and so on. I would have to iterate the trick on top of itself, and maybe more times on top of that.
					</p>
					<p>
						What we have to do is consider covering, in the abstract, various intervals\[[0,\varepsilon]\]for various values of $\varepsilon.$ Notably, the genie can always play tricks up to any particular value of $\varepsilon,$ but we can always overcome the genie at this single $\varepsilon.$ The way to formalize the idea that we can "always push farther'' up to $1$ is via the least upper-bound property, fixing $\varepsilon$ the farthest we can push, as done above.
