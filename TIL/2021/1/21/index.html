					<h2>January 21st</h2>
					<p>Today I learned an alternative proof of Wilson's theorem, from group actions. The main result is something called the $p$-group fixed point theorem, from <a href="https://qchu.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/the-p-group-fixed-point-theorem/">here</a>. Namely, if a finite $p$-group $G$ acts on a set $X$ then the set of fixed points $X^G$ satisfies\[|X|\equiv\left|X^G\right|\pmod p.\]This follows directly from the class equation. Quickly, for $x\in G,$ we can biject cosets in $G/\op{Stab}_x$ with elements in the orbit $Gx$ (explicitly, $g\op{Stab}_x\mapsto gx$), we see that\[|X|=\sum_{\text{orbits }Gx}|Gx|=\sum_{\text{orbits }Gx}[G:\op{Stab}_x]=\sum_{\text{orbits }Gx}\frac{|G|}{|\op{Stab}_x|}.\]Now, $|\op{Stab}_x|$ divides $|G|$ and is therefore a power of $p,$ so $|G|/|\op{Stab}_x|$ is as well. So this is divisible by $p$ unless it is equal to $1,$ in which case $|Gx|=1$ exactly describes $x\in X^G,$ so $1\cdot\left|X^G\right|$ exactly measures the perturbations$\pmod p.$</p>
					<p>Anyways, let's kill Wilson's theorem with our new black magic. We need to talk about $(p-1)!\pmod p,$ so we would like to make a set $X$ with size $(p-1)!.$ We can get a $p!$ by taking permutations of $\FF_p,$ but to get down to $(p-1)!,$ we need to divide out that factor of $p.$ The way we do this is by identifying the permutations\[(a_1,\ldots,a_p)\sim(a_1+k,\ldots,a_p+k)\]for any $(a_1,\ldots,a_p)\in S_p$ and $k\in\FF_p.$ Here the notation $(a_1,\ldots,a_p)$ denotes the permutation $n\mapsto a_n.$ So we define\[X=S_p/\sim,\]where $\sim$ is defined as above. One way to look at this is as fixing the last element: there is exactly one $k$ which will take $a_p=0,$ for example. However, we would like to make a $p$-group act on this thing, so having $p$-tuples makes it natural to make $G:=\ZZ/p\ZZ$ act on $X$ by shifts, like\[[n]_p\cdot(a_1,\ldots,a_p)=(a_{1+n},\ldots,a_{p+n}),\]where indices are taken$\pmod p.$</p>
					<p>It remains to compute the number of fixed points of this action. Well, a permutation will be fixed as long as\[(a_1,\ldots,a_p)\sim(a_{1+n},\ldots,a_{p+n})\]for each $n\in\ZZ/p\ZZ.$ In fact, because $\ZZ/p\ZZ$ is cyclic, it really suffices to check $n=1,$ so we need a constant $k$ such that\[(a_1,\ldots,a_p)=(a_2+k,\ldots,a_1+k,a_p+k).\]That is, we need $a_\bullet\equiv a_{\bullet+1}+k\pmod p.$ To count the number of such tuples, we note that all tuples are equivalent to one with $a_1=0$ (explicitly, $k=-a_1$), in which case these look like $(0,k,2k,\ldots,(p-1)k).$ Because these tuples need to contain distinct elements, there are only $p-1$ options for $k.$ (All of these work because multiplication by $k$ is a bijection.) Thus, we have $\left|X^G\right|=p-1$ fixed points, which implies\[(p-1)!\equiv(p-1)\equiv-1\pmod p.\]This is Wilson's theorem, so we are done here.</p>
