						October 27th

					<p>
						Today I learned a proof (after having skimmed one a few days ago) that a Galois extension is completely determined by its completely split primes. For a Galois extension $K/\QQ$ (or $L/K$; the proof extends), let $\op{Spl}(K/\QQ)$ be the set of primes which split completely.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, the claim we show is that for two Galois extensions $K/\QQ$ and $L/\QQ,$ $K$ is a subfield of $L$ if and only if more primes completely split in $K$ than in $L,$ in the sense that $\op{Spl}(L/\QQ)\subseteq\op{Spl}(K/\QQ).$ Indeed, if $K$ is a subfield of $L,$ then a prime splitting completely in $L$ will split completely in $K$ for free because the ramification and inertial information are multiplicative in towers and so upper-bounded by $1.$
					</p>
					<p>
						The converse is harder. The setup is to consider the field composite $LK,$ and the main idea is to use our connection between completely splitting primes and field invariants&mdash;namely, the Dirichlet density of completely split primes is the reciprocal of the degree. In symbols,\[\frac1{[LK:\QQ]}=\lim_{s\to1^+}\dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{p\in\op{Spl}(LK/\QQ)}\frac1{p^s}}{\displaystyle\sum_p\frac1{p^s}}\]from our discussion yesterday. However, a prime splits completely in $LK$ if and only if it splits completely in both $L$ and $K$; we show the converse later, but the forward direction is discussed above. So the fact that the primes which split completely in $L$ also split completely in $K$ tells us that we only care about the primes which split completely in $L.$ Namely, $\op{Spl}(LK/\QQ)=\op{Spl}(L/\QQ),$ which implies\[\frac1{[LK:\QQ]}=\lim_{s\to1^+}\dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{p\in\op{Spl}(LK/\QQ)}\frac1{p^s}}{\displaystyle\sum_p\frac1{p^s}}=\lim_{s\to1^+}\dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{p\in\op{Spl}(L/\QQ)}\frac1{p^s}}{\displaystyle\sum_p\frac1{p^s}}=\frac1{[L:\QQ]}.\]To finish, we write\[[LK:L]=\frac{[LK:\QQ]}{[L:\QQ]}=1,\]so $L=LK,$ and $K$ is indeed a subfield of $L.$
					</p>
					<p>
						To get the result we want, it follows that if $\op{Spl}(K/\QQ)=\op{Spl}(L/\QQ),$ then each is a subset of the other, so each of $K$ and $L$ are a subfield of the other, so $L=K.$ This is the statement that the set of completely split primes entirely determines the field extension, which is equivalent to the statement $K\mapsto\op{Spl}(K/\QQ)$ is an injective function, as shown.
					</p>
					<p>
						I guess I should show that if a prime splits completely in $L$ and $K,$ then it also splits completely in the composite $LK.$ The trick is to take $M$ a normal extension containing $LK$ and then note that the decomposition field of a certain prime contains $L$ and $K$ (because the prime splits completely) and so contains $LK,$ implying that the prime splits completely. In particular, we are using the characterization that the decomposition field is the largest intermediate field such that the prime $\mf p/p$ has $e(\mf p/p)=f(\mf p/p)=1.$
