						Today I learned that for any polynomial $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\ZZ_p[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ has a root in $(\ZZ_p)^n$ if and only if has roots in each $(\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ)^n.$ One direction of this easy. Indeed, if we have a root $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)\in(\ZZ_p)^n,$ then\[P(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)=0\]in $\ZZ_p.$ Reducing all values$\pmod{p^\bullet}$ will give an equality there as well, so we get our solution in $(\ZZ/p^\bullet)^n$ by projecting $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n).$
					</p>
					<p>
						The harder direction is that if we have solutions for $P$ in $(\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ)^n$ for each $p^\bullet,$ then we can piece together a solution in $(\ZZ_p)^n.$ For this, we construct a Cauchy sequence in Hensel style. This is done in inductive-style steps. We construct a sequence of solutions\[(\alpha_{1,\bullet},\ldots,\alpha_{n,\bullet}),\]which holds in $(\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ)^n$ and satisfies $\alpha_{k,\bullet}\equiv\alpha_{k,\bullet+1}\pmod{p^\bullet}$; this of course makes a Cauchy sequence for each $\alpha_{k,\bullet}$ which converges to a solution $\alpha_k$ in $\ZZ_p.$ So this will be enough to give our solution in $(\ZZ_p)^n.$
					</p>
					<p>
						The trick is that we're going to construct our solution such that, when reducing all of the solutions $(\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ)^n$ to our particular $(\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ)^n,$ infinitely many fall on top of $(\alpha_{1,\bullet},\ldots,\alpha_{n,\bullet}).$
					</p>
					<p>
						As our base case, we begin with\[(\alpha_{1,0},\ldots,\alpha_{n,0})=(0,\ldots,0),\]which is a solution to $P$ in $(\ZZ/p^0\ZZ)^n.$ Further note that reducing any of our solutions to $P$ of $(\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ)^n$ into $(\ZZ/p^0\ZZ)^n$ will project here, so infinitely many lie on top of $(0,\ldots,0).$
					</p>
					<p>
						Now suppose we have a solution $(\alpha_{1,\ell},\ldots,\alpha_{n,\ell})$ satisfying the statement. Reducing all of our solutions of $P$ in each $(\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ)^n$ into $(\ZZ/p^\ell\ZZ)^n,$ we have infinitely many that lie on top of $(\alpha_{1,\ell},\ldots,\alpha_{n,\ell}),$ by inductive hypothesis. Raising this into $(\ZZ/p^{\ell+1}\ZZ),$ note that there are only $p^n$ possible residues in $(\ZZ/p^{\ell+1}\ZZ)^n$ equivalent to $(\alpha_{1,\ell},\ldots,\alpha_{n,\ell}).$ However, infinitely many fall into this group of residue classes, so one of the $p^n$ residue classes must appear infinitely often. Name this class of $(\ZZ/p^{\ell+1}\ZZ)^n$ as\[(\alpha_{1,\ell+1},\ldots,\alpha_{n,\ell+1}).\]By construction, we have $\alpha_{k,\ell}\equiv a_{k+1,\ell}\pmod{p^\ell}$ for each $k,$ and infinitely many solutions fell on top of this residue class, making this a solution in $(\ZZ/p^\ell\ZZ)^n$ as well. This completes the inductive step.
					</p>
					<p>
						This does complete the proof, with our Cauchy sequence in hand. What I find interesting about this proof is that it doesn't really use the fact that we're dealing with a polynomial anywhere in the proof. I guess implicitly used is that if\[P(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)\equiv0\pmod{p^{\bullet+1}},\]then the equivalence holds in$\pmod{p^\bullet}$ as well, which is somewhat contingent on this being a polynomial. However, this is really it. Our polynomial can have as many variables as needed, it can be of any degree, it's coefficients can be anything from $\ZZ_p,$ and so on. It might even be possible to let these be power series, but this runs the risk of convergence problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						Professor Kedlaya made the remark that this lemma is a bit misleading, in that it suggests that we need infinite information (solutions for each $\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ$) to get a solution in $\ZZ_p.$ Of course, this is not the case, a la Hensel's Lemma and the various ways to strengthen it. The prototypical example is quadratic residues, where, for $p \gt 2,$\[x^2\equiv c\pmod{p^\bullet}\]with $p\nmid c$ will have solutions if and only if $\left(\frac cp\right)=1.$ This is a finite check to get the infinite information that we need. The proof of this statement is exactly Hensel's Lemma, for the derivative of $x^2-c$ is $2x,$ the only roots of which are $0$ for $p=2.$ We have to push a little bit harder to get $p=2,$ I suppose, but it still only amounts to a finite check.
