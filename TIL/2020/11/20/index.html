					<h2>November 20th</h2>
					<p>Today I learned that the group $\QQ/\ZZ$ has every finite cyclic group as a unique subgroup, and in fact no subgroup of it suffices. For one, all finite cyclic groups appear as $\langle 1/n\rangle$ for size $n.$</p>
					<p>Uniqueness is a bit more obnoxious to show. Suppose $G\subseteq\QQ/\ZZ$ is a finite cyclic subgroup of order $n.$ We need to show $G=\langle1/n\rangle.$ Well, suppose $g\in G$ generates. Then $ng=0\pmod\ZZ,$ so\[ng=m\in\ZZ.\]It follows $g=\frac mn.$ Namely, $G=\langle g\rangle\subseteq\langle1/n\rangle.$ However, both of these sets have the same size while one is the subset of the other, so we must in fact have equality.</p>
					<p>We close, for now, by showing that no proper subgroup of $\QQ/\ZZ$ has this property. In particular, if a subgroup is proper, then it misses some element, say $\frac mn.$ But then we cannot have $\frac1n$ either, for this would imply $\frac mn$ is present. It follows that the proper subgroup is missing the subgroup $\langle1/n\rangle,$ and is therefore missing the only subgroup of order $n$ in $\QQ/\ZZ.$ It follows that the proper subgroup is missing some finite cyclic subgroups.</p>
					<p>Quickly, this is not quite the property I was looking for&mdash;namely, I was interested in an infinite group with only finite proper subgroups. In fact, the Pr\"uffer group $\ZZ[1/p]/\ZZ$ suffices. Indeed, define the degree of a subgroup $G$ of $\ZZ[1/p]/\ZZ$ as the largest power of $p$ in the denominator of any element of $\ZZ[1/p]/\ZZ.$ We have the following cases.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>     If the degree is in fact unbounded, then the subgroup $G$ is all of $\ZZ[1/p]/\ZZ,$ and this is not a proper subgroup; namely, we can achieve every element of the form $a/p^\bullet$ because we have unbounded denominators.</li>
						<li>     Else the degree is bounded, so well-order gives us a least integer $d$ such that if $a/p^k\in G$ with $p\nmid a,$ then $k\le d.$ We claim that the group is $\langle1/p^d\rangle,$ which is finite cyclic of order $p^d.$ Indeed, we are at least a subset of this because $p^d$ is an upper-bound on the denominator. But in the other direction, there is some $a$ for which $a/p^d\in G$ and $p\nmid a.$ However, this means    \[a^{-1}\pmod{p^d}\]    exists, so $aa^{-1}/p^k=1/p^k$ in $\ZZ[1/p]/\ZZ.$ This completes the proof.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Of course, I suppose the caveat to this proof is that we are only using prime-powers for our subgroup sizes, which is the advantage of $\QQ/\ZZ.$</p>
