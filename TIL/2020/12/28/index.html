						Today I learned some $\lambda$ calculus for type theory. Essentially, we can define functions $A\to B$ (where $A,B:\mathcal U$ are types) by writing\[(\lambda x.\Phi):A\to B.\]Here $\Phi$ is just some expression maybe involving $x.$ The function is well-defined if and only if $(\lambda x.\Phi)(a)\equiv\Phi':B$ where $\Phi'$ is the expression $\Phi$ where each instance of $x$ is replaced by $a:A.$ Formally, we should write $\lambda(x:A).\Phi$ or similar, but this is redundant when we know that the codomain is $A$ anyways.
					</p>
					<p>
						The rule where we may write\[(\lambda x.\Phi)(a)\equiv\Phi'\]by replacing instances of $x$ in $\Phi$ with an $a$ to get $\Phi$ is called $\beta$-reduction. Another manipulation rule we have is that for a given function $f:A\to B,$ we may write\[f\equiv(\lambda x.f(x)).\]This is called $\eta$-expansion. Essentially, this says that two functions are equal if they are equal on all inputs, for the $\lambda$ expression is pretty much just an abstract list of all possible expressions. There is also $\alpha$-conversion, where we can say\[\lambda x.\Phi_x\equiv\lambda y.\Phi_y,\]where $\Phi_y$ is just $\Phi_x$ with all $x$s replaced with $y$s. In other words, the dummy variable may be exchanged.
					</p>
					<p>
						I feel obligated to talk about currying. The idea is that we can "simulate'' multiple inputs to a function by making functions output other functions. Explicitly, we may think of a function\[f:A\to(B\to C)\]as taking in two inputs $a:A$ and $b:B$ and outputting $f(a)(b):C.$ As an aside on notation, our arrows are right-associative by convention, so we could (unambiguously) write the above as $f:A\to B\to C.$ We are sweeping under the rug having to think about the fact that $f(a):B\to C$ and just thinking about the composite after applying $b:B.$ Oftentimes we abbreviate this to $f(a,b).$
