This document contains some things that I learned. To be clear, sometimes I'll have skimmed a text in advance so that I already know the statement. So when I say ``learn,'' I'll mean something roughly isomorphic to ``learned a proof of.''

A remark on style: my writing here is not good mathematical writing, per se. The goal in the presentation is not clarity but motivation, so I will often give arguments which appear more awkward than the standard argument in order to talk about why we are doing what we're doing. I find this personally helpful, given that this is my mathematical diary, but your mileage may vary.
